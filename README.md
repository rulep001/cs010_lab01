# CS 10 - Lab 1: Hello World

## Overview
To gain experience with the tools we utilize in CS 010 and CS 010v, in addition to understanding the basics about various items students will use throughout the quarter.

## Requirements
1. Copy the file in lab00. It should be named `hello_world.cpp`. Paste a copy into `lab01`.
2. Right click and rename the file that you just pasted, rename the file to `lab1.cpp`.
3. Open the `lab1.cpp` file and place the proper assessment header at the top.
4. Compile and execute your program (you may need to first navigate to the proper directory lab01, using `cd` to change directory in your terminal).
    * use the g++ command to compile
        * no such file? make sure the file exists with ls, and use `cd` to navigate
    * use `./a.out` to execute, once compiled and an a.out executable file exists
        * Upon execution, you should see the output "Hello World!" within your terminal
    * Recall the commands from the README.md in your C9 workspace.
5. Download the `lab1.cpp` file and submit it to the proper R'Sub submission area
